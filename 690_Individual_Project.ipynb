I would also consider looking at humidity level and temperature trends and the frequency of tornados/tornado warnings.  I'd also like to see whether the trends are different in more-densely vs. less-densely populated areas.  I'd like to see what months have been the wettest historically.  If there is a shift, that would affect vegetation and wildlife which would be a true climate shift.  "
